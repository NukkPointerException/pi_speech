# py-nltools

A collection of random bits and pieces of code for natural language processing. Most of them are
pretty hands-on simple-minded compared to projects like NLTK ot spaCy and therefore in no way meant
to replace those. 

Non-exhaustive liste of modules contained:

* phonetics: translation functions between various phonetic alphabets (IPA, X-SAMPA, X-ARPABET, ...)


I plan to add modules as I need them in my AI projects.


Requirements
============

*Note*: very incomplete.

* Python 2.7
